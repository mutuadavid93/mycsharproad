### Interfaces
	Declared using the interface keyword.
	An interface can only contain declarations but no implementations.

	NB: Convention, prefix the Name with a capital "I" i.e interface ICustomer{ }

	NB: Interface members are public by default, but you can't explicitly have
		the public access modifier. i.e 
			Correct: void interfaceMember();
			Wrong: public void interfaceMember();

	#Interface can't have a field e.g int passMark;
	
	#A class inheriting an interface must implement "ALL" the interface members.
		The methods should have same signatures.

NB: A struct or a class can Inherit from multiple Interfaces @thesame time.

NB: You can't create an instance of an Interface but you can have an Interface reference 
	variable point to a derived class object.

	i.e because the Interface its a Parent of a class by default in C#.
