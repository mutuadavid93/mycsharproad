### Properties
	Exposing your fields with public access modifier its wrong since it makes us
		lose control of what gets into the fields and what goes out of the fields.

	* we use setters and getters methods to allow safer access and gain control
		of what is assigned to those fields.

	NB: the setter method is void whereas the getter method can't be void and
		must return a value. 
		i.e in the setter this._id = id; then getter return this._id;

	NB: To make fields ReadOnly, we use only the getter method but avoid the
		setter method. so no one will ever change that field's value.

### C# does not need to use setter and getter properties by default. It has a choice;
	* We use both set and get methods inside one method.
	* the value set in the invokation is what is assigned to the "value" in the property

	NB: get / set accessors refer to Read / Write respectively.
		* get is Read only 
		* set is Write only

	NB: When there is no logic int the fields, then we can use auto implement properties
		i.e public int studentID { get; set; }
