### Late Binding
	Early Binding is used by default in most cases.

## Late Binding, Used when we don't have Knowledge of the class at compile time.
	Steps:
		* Load the ExecutingAssembly
		* GetTypes within that assembly
		* Instatiate the Type (class)
		* Get the Method information we want to Execute
		* Create an array of the Parameters to pass in the Method
		* Invoke the method. You have to Typecast the object to string.

NB: But its Ironical, The class and the Method are still required at runtime, so
	create them!!!

Cons:
	Its complicated.
	Slower than Early Binding.
	Errors only flagged at Runtime.

NB: ONLY use Late Binding when working with "Objects that are not available at Runtime".
