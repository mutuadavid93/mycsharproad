### Delegate trick and tips

	* Create the function with the logic and pass a "List" and a "delegate" 
		instance as parameters.

		i.e public static void logicMethod(listInstance, delegateInstance) { }

	* This means we have to declare a List then add data into it, declare a delegate
		with same signature as the function its pointing to.

	* Create your method with same signature as the delegate and pass the message 
		as a parameter. In this method, evaluate your logic. 
	
		NB: You are using the default properties in your conditional statement 
			to set the condition.

	* Instantiate your delegate and pass the method as a parameter.

	* Inside the foreach loop of the logicMethod, initialize the delegate's function by 
		passing the data as a parameter.
		i.e proceeding(student);
	
	* Finally invoke the logicMethod inside the main() and pass the reference vars 
		of the "List" and the "Delegate".

NB: The delegate Must always be outside the classes and outside the main() body!!

Whooah! You are done.
