### Differences btn System.String and System.StringBuilder
	
	System.String is Immutable => i.e It consumes memory and that memory is 
		never freed. e.g string manipulation by concatenation.

		It results into "orphaned string objects" in memory which are only
		cleared by garbage collector.

	System.StringBuilder is Mutable => i.e Same string object will be changed 
		in memory no matter how many times the variable changes.

		Create an Instance of the StringBuilder object and use Append() to 
		concatenate the other bits of the string.

NB: System.String is in System.String Namespace but System.StringBuilder is in System.Text
		Namespace.


NB: When ever there is Heavy string manipulation is involved, use StringBuilder instead
  	of String. E.g in Looping Strings.

	Benefits: Performance improved.
