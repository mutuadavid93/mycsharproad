### Attributes
	Allow you to add declarative information to your programmes. 

	e.g Warning that a function is now deprecated and give hint of what's the 
	current funtion of completing the same task.

	i.e [Obsolete] and you can as well pass parameters i.e [Obsolete("Message")]

### Reflection
	Ability of inspecting an Assemblie's meta-data at runtime. e.g How many 
	Types does an assembly have, how many type members does a Type have?

	Reflection enables us to use code that isn't available at compiletime 
	(Late Binding).

# When you want the Type class in Reflection you can use two ways;
	* typeof keyword, and GetType().
