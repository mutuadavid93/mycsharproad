### Multiple class iheritance using interfaces
	
You have two classes (A, B) inheriting from interfaces(IA, IB) respectively,
	and another class (AB) which inherits both the interfaces. Inside class AB 
	we will have to create the instances of the two classes then invoke the 
	member method from each of the classes (A and B). 

Thus we have provided the implementation.

Syntax/Trick: You have a set of classes which inherit from different interfaces,
		then Another Single class which implements the latter classes 
		indirectly through inheriting their interfaces.
