### Partial Methods
	Partial Method has two parts => A method declaration and the implementation. 
		which can be in the same file or in different partial classes.

	i.e 
		declare: partial void SamplePartialMethod();
		implement: partial void SamplePartialMethod() { //statements }

NB: partial methods are private by default BUT you CANNOT have explicit access 
	modifiers.

NB: All return types of any partial method are "void".

NB: Signature of partial method declaration, must match with the signature of the
	implementation.

NB: A partial method can only exist within a partial Type.

NB: A partial method can only be implemented once.
