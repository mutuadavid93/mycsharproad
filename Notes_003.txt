### Polymorphism
	Enables you to invoke derived class methods through baseClass reference 
	variable at runtime.

	i.e baseClass BCRV = new derivedClass();
		BCRV.derivedClassMethod();

	NB: Polymorphism uses method overriding: the method to be overriden is declared 
		with a "virtual" keyword 
				i.e public virtual void printfullname{ }

		then the overriding method is declared
		with an "overrride" keyword
				i.e public override void printfullname() { }

	NB: virtual keyword means that the method can be overriden by any of the derived 
		classes' methods.

### Method overriding vs Method hidding
	* Method overriding, a base class reference variable pointing to a derived class
		object, will invoke the "overriden method in the child class".
		i.e the childClass method will execute.

	*Method hidding, a base class reference variable pointing to a child class object
		, will invoke the "hidden method in the base class".
		i.e the baseClass method will execute.

	NB: new keyword must be present in the hidding method.
		i.e public new void printFullName() { }

### Method overloadding
	Same function name but different signature i.e Number of parameters being differrent 
	in count and/or types or kinds (e.g output and byvalue).

NB: Method overloadding and Method overriding are used interchangeably (similar);
