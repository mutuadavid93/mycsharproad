### Explicit interfaces implementation

	Inside the class which implements the interface method;
		* The method is declared void without access modifier.
		* Its name appended with the interface's name.

		i.e void InterfaceName.methodName () {  }

	Explicitly implemented interface members can only be invoked through
		typeCasting: i.e ((IinterfaceName)obj reference variable).method();

		e.g ((IStudent)std).printStudentName();

	If you want to make one of the interfaces default, you implement its member
		normally and the other member explicitly and invoke by "class reference" 
		and "typecasting" respectively.
